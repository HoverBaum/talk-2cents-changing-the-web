<Impact>Bigger picture</Impact>

<Notes>


## The bigger picture

- Web monetization is doing for content monetization what many others are doing for different fields â†’ Breaking up the monopole of platforms. Moving responsibilities to protocols gives governance back to the public.
- Decentralized services are the future.

<SlideHeadline sectionTitle="ActivityPub"></SlideHeadline>

<CustomSplit>


- Another example of moving responsibilities to the protocol.
- Activity push is a protocol for "social media platforms". It can replace Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

## Cermon

- Protocols allow more freedom and creativity. They are what we should aim for.
- After all, there isn't a big single mainframe we connect to to create our websites through a proprietary editor. The web is and has always been, in it's foundations open and free. Build upon a strong foundation of protocols.
- A move towards protocols instead of platforms is a move towards the roots of the web.

---

## Closing

The move from platforms to protocols has been going for years. Many, recent developments are fueling it. Still, it may be decades before we see the realization of this brave new world. But as consultants at the forefront of digitalization we should keep a look out for what is to come.
